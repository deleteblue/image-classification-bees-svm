First HOG features have been extracted from images. Then PCA has been implemented to the features so that the principal components can be use in the SVM. For evaluation ROC curve has been plotted as well.  <br>
Zip file of images downloaded from DataCamp are corrupted and cannot be opened. But in the DataCamp environment they worked and the notebook is generated in that environment. <br>
